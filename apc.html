        <p><img class="small" src="img/dogleash.jpg" alt="Dog with leash"/> </p>
        <p>Daily dog walks are our specialty at 4 Pets’ Sake. Recommended for every dog, but a must for clients who work extra long hours, for older dogs who just can’t hold it like they used to, and active dogs with boundless energy. We will walk your dog individually for at least 20 minutes on leash in your neighborhood. We are also happy to play ball or Frisbee (in secure areas) with your dog, providing them with the exercise and attention that they enjoy most.  Extended playtime/walk time available for an additional fee. $22/visit* with monthly discounts available at 10% off</p>

As a complimentary service, we also water indoor plants, bring in the mail, and rotate the lights/blinds to help deter burglary. $25/visit*</p>
